abstract: The Cyberbullying Scale was previously developed to measure the degree to which adolescents experience cyberbullying via the internet. The aim of the present study was to validate the Korean version of the Cyberbullying Scale in a South Korean sample. The Cyberbullying Scale was administrated to 481 middle school Korean students. These students also completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale (LS), Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A), and the Korean Form of the Children's Depression Inventory (K-CDI). Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis supported a one factor solution. The Cyberbullying Scale total score also demonstrated satisfactory convergent validity and significant positive correlations with the LS, K-CDI and SAS-A. The Cyberbullying scale total score also evidenced satisfactory discriminant validity with the EDI-2. The Cyberbullying Scale total score was also associated with good reliability, as estimated via internal consistency. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed.
