abstract: When conducting psychological research, it is imperative to utilize appropriate measurement
instruments that are well-established and demonstrate a high level of reliability and validity.
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is one of the methods most frequently used in psychometric
studies to examine the validity of scales in the field of psychology. Despite its widespread use,
EFA has been plagued with incorrect usage. The aim of the present study was to review and critically
evaluate the factor analytic practices reported in Korean academic journals of psychology from
2007 to 2016. 280 papers that included exploratory factor analysis were collected for review.
The analyses revealed several types of application errors frequently made when using EFA. First,
approximately 59% of the articles did not report the results of KMO & Bartlett's sphericity test.
Second, 20% of the studies whose aim was scale development and validation used principal
component analysis to extract the factors, which is a practice not recommended for this purpose.
Lastly, ignoring the significant correlational relationships among the factors, many researchers
implemented orthogonal rotation methods. Other problems and issues were also discussed and
desirable solutions for these challenges were suggested.
