abstract: The purpose of the present study was to examine the mediating effects of self-efficacy in the relationship between loneliness and social media addiction. The study was based on 341 undergraduate female students (mean age=20.52 years, SD=1.85) at a university in Seoul, Korea who completed the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale, and SNS Addiction Tendency Scale. Based on the correlational analyses, results revealed that loneliness was negatively related with self-efficacy and positively related with social media addiction tendency. Self-efficacy was also negatively correlated with social media addiction tendency. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that self-efficacy fully mediated the relationship between loneliness and social media addiction tendency. These results highlight the importance of evaluating self-efficacy when studying social media addiction, as well as addressing the effects that loneliness may have on self-efficacy in order to lower the risk for social media addiction. Study limitations are also discussed.
