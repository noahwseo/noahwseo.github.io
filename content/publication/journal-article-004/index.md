abstract: The Weight Concern Scale (WCS) was developed in North America to identify female students at risk of developing eating disorders. The aim of the present study was to validate the Korean version of the Weight Concern Scale in a South Korean female sample. Six hundred and fifty-six women completed the Weight Concern Scale and Body Shape Questionnaire. Based on results from exploratory factor analysis, a unidimensional structure was found to be appropriate. Confirmatory factor analysis for cross validation purposes revealed that the single factor model fit the data well. The internal consistency of the Weight Concern Scale was good, and it showed a significant correlation with the Body Shape Questionnaire, supporting convergent validity. Finally, implications and limitations of these results were discussed.
